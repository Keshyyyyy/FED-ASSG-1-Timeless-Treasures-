What is the website catering for?
A platform to resell branded goods from trusted sources to customers who are looking after specific products that are hard to come by from the physical store and official store websites.

External User’s Goal:
The site’s users are individuals who are into the world of fashion and are up to date with the latest design trends and products specifically those coming from designer brands such as Louis Vuitton, Salvatore Ferragamo and so on. Having said that, since these items are so sought after, they are often sold out relatively fast upon being put up for sale in their official websites as well as physical stores hence the users of this website are individuals who value branded goods and are willing to buy those exact items at a resale price from an online trusted source.

Site owner’s goal:
Presenting the items being listed on the platform in the best possible way in order to satisfy customer user experience and increase engagement amongst potential customers.
